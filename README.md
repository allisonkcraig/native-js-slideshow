## <a name="drafting"></a>Drafting with Canvas
####Using HTML5
HTML5 Canvas was used to draft my pattern blocks. Canvas uses a system of (x,y) axis on a grid that starts at (0,0) at the top left corner. This was counter intuitive to how blocks are drafted by hand but it was a fun challenge. 


## <a name="v2"></a>Version 2.0

The next steps I am taking are to hash passwords before saving to database, add beta key system for a test audience, and set up an introductory video or tutorial for new users.
